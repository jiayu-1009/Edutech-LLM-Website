这个项目投入了我非常非常多心血，是我第一个完整的教育网站。

这个网站实现了用户注册、登录的功能，登陆过后将会看到一个弹窗，弹窗中的作用是收集学生此刻的情绪状态，作为研究数据。
完成弹窗中的题目之后，即可开始与大语言模型进行交互。该大语言模型调用自zhipu的API，在后台经过特定的数据训练，
可作为本课的教学助理，为同学们解答专业相关的内容。用户与大语言模型的所有交互内容将会在后台被收集，这些交互数据将会被进一步分析。

This is my first completed project. Development began in August 2024, went live in September 2024,
and the experiment was completed in December 2024. I put a tremendous amount of effort into this project,
and it's my first and currently only complete educational website.

This website implements user registration and login. After logging in, 
a pop-up window will appear, collecting students' current emotional state for research data.
After completing the questions in the pop-up window, you can begin interacting with the large language model. 
This large language model, which uses the Zhipu API and is trained with specific data in the backend, 
serves as a teaching assistant for this course, providing students with answers related to their major. 
All user interactions with the large language model are collected in the backend for further analysis.

这个项目的设计中包含了我自己个人的非常多巧思，例如我会在登陆界面弹出一个窗口，同学们可以看到我在窗口上的寄语。
两个界面背景均来自于宫崎骏的电影《天空之城》，这是我最喜欢的电影之一，因为我希望通过一门与大语言模型合作的课，
不仅仅让他们认识到人工智能，更希望同学们可以学会与人工智能、技术共处的方式。这种共生的和谐状态也是《天空之城》这部电影想要传递的。

This project's design incorporates many of my own ingenious ideas. For example, I created a pop-up window on the login screen 
where students can see my message. Both screen backgrounds are inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's film "Castle in the Sky," one of my favorites. 
I hope that through a course involving large language models, I can not only introduce students to AI but also teach them 
how to coexist with AI and technology. This harmonious symbiosis is also the theme of "Castle in the Sky."

我知道这是极其简陋的作品，但是我依然非常非常爱她。我希望自己可以在将来独立做出更棒的产品，一定可以
最后我把这段，在最后一次课时留下的寄语也放在这里，与各位参观者共勉。
I know this is a very crude piece, but I still love it dearly. I hope I can independently create even better products in the future. I definitely can.
Finally, I'd like to share these words from my final class here with all of you who have come to this class.

            <p>亲爱的同学你好，</p>

            <p>今天，应该是最后一次与你们见面,这也是最后一份opening talk~</p>
            <p>在离别之前，想最后留给大家一段提醒。请勿盲目相信AI给你的答案。尝试着反问它、质疑它、反驳它...</p>
            <p>不难发现，人工智能有些见风使舵，回答会出现前后矛盾的地方.</p>
            <p>人工智能不代表真理，使用人工智能的目的也非获得一劳永逸的回答</p>
            <p>希望各位在进入高等教育之始,学会与“人工”智能相处,也请诸位多一些怀疑,多一份独立的思考.</p>
            <p>期待我能够在后台和大家共同进步，十一月快乐！                         </p>

<p>Hello, dear students!</p>
<p>I'm Jiayu, the project leader for the 2024 Undergraduate Research Training Municipal Program, and the creator of this platform.</p>

<p>Please note that the login and logout procedures have been revised. Please complete them carefully.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Today is likely the last time I see you, and this is also my last opening talk.</p>
<p>Before we part, I'd like to leave you with a final reminder. Do not blindly trust the answers given by AI. Try to question it, challenge it, refute it...</p>
<p>It's not hard to find that AI can be somewhat opportunistic, and its answers can be inconsistent.</p>
<p>AI doesn't represent truth, and the purpose of using AI isn't to obtain definitive answers.</p>
<p>I hope that as you begin your higher education, you'll learn to coexist with "artificial" intelligence. I also ask that you be more skeptical and think independently.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you backstage. Happy November!</p>
<p>If you have any programming questions, please contact me or Si Chen, another member of the team, via WeChat.</p>
